# Tetris Game in Python

## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using Python and Pygame. The game includes essential Tetris mechanics such as piece rotation, movement, and line clearing.

## Features
- Different Tetrimino shapes with unique colors
- Smooth piece movement and rotation
- Automatic falling of pieces
- Line clearing when a row is completely filled
- Game-over detection

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed along with the Pygame library. You can install Pygame using:

```sh
pip install pygame
```

## How to Run
Run the game using the following command:

```sh
python tetris.py
```

## Controls
- **Left Arrow (←)**: Move piece left
- **Right Arrow (→)**: Move piece right
- **Down Arrow (↓)**: Speed up piece drop
- **Up Arrow (↑)**: Rotate piece
- **Escape (ESC)**: Quit the game

## Game Mechanics
1. A random Tetrimino spawns at the top of the grid.
2. The player moves and rotates the piece to fit within the grid.
3. When a row is completely filled, it disappears, and the player gains points.
4. If the pieces stack to the top, the game ends.
